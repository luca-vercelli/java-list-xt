Java Class ListXt providing common extensions

In Java, `List` interface miss some important methods, that are present in other paradigms (es. JavaScript or Java Stream's): `filter`, `find`, `map`.

We create an interface `ListXt` extending the `List` interface with several default methods, and two example implementations `ArrayListXt` and `LinkedListXt`.
